# WagWay -- Walk. Wag. Woof.

## Overview

The WagWay API is a backend service designed to connect dog owners with dog walkers. With an emphasis on convenience and flexibility, the API allows users to find walkers based on location, availability, and price. Built on Ruby on Rails, this service utilizes the power of geolocation and complex SQL queries to provide a smooth and efficient user experience.

## Features

- **Geolocation-based Search**: Utilizes the Geocoder gem to find walkers within a certain radius of the owner's location.
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Allows users to search for available walkers based on specific time slots.
- **Price Filtering**: Walkers can set their own prices, allowing owners to choose based on their budget.
- **Walk Tracking**: Provides a model to track the status, location, and timing of each walk.
